A checklist for TA's convenience.

For each tasks check both the issue and implementation (most often PR).

- [ ] 0. Setup: repo created and access configured  
- [ ] 1. Product & Architecture: Product selected + architecture description ready (architecture.md)
- [ ] 2. Architecture Diagram: Diagram created and committed (PNG/SVG + source file)  
- [ ] 3. Roles-and-skills.md complete: roles per module, roadmap.sh reflection, job postings  
- [ ] 4. Peer Review: one PR reviewed **by** a classmate, and another **for** a classmate.
- [ ] 5. Personal Reflection: reflection.md complete  
- [ ] 6. Stretch Task (optional): Completed any stretch task  

TA walks around, looks at repo + PRs, signs off in his own file, a full participation point is given if all non-optional tasks are complete. If more than half than 0.5, if all and at least one optional then 1.5.
